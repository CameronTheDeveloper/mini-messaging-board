# Overview
The Mini Messaging Board is a platform where users can contribute messages by accessing a link and filling out a form, including their username and associated message. This project serves as a means for me to strengthen my skills in Node.js using the Express framework and PostgreSQL.

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used to build the backend of the application.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database management system used to store and manage the messages submitted by users.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating for rendering dynamic content on the web pages.

## Features
- **Message Board**: Users can view all messages that have been posted.
- **Message Submission**: Users can submit their own messages by providing a username and a message via a simple form.
- **Database Integration**: All messages are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence and reliability.
